## Installing Root Certificate (macOS)

We need to add the root certificate to any laptops, desktops, tablets, and phones that will be accessing your HTTPS sites. This can be a bit of a pain, but the good news is that we only have to do it once. Once our root certificate is on each device, it will be good until it expires.

### Adding the Root Certificate to macOS Keychain

1. Open the macOS Keychain app
1. Go to File > Import Items…
1. Select your root certificate file (i.e. myCA.pem)
1. Search for whatever you answered as the Common Name name above
